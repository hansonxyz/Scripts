# Scripts Repository

This repository is a collection of the most useful scripts that are used on a day-to-day basis. 

## Descriptions 

1. **tmux_remote_persistent.sh**: This script enables connection to a remote Linux system and initializes a tmux session. It provides resilience by automatically reconnecting to the tmux session in case the terminal is unexpectedly disconnected.

2. **db.sh**: A handy tool designed for Laravel and WordPress projects that simplifies the interaction with MySQL databases directly from the shell.

3. **encrypt_tar.sh**: This script generates an encrypted tar.gz file and a companion shell script. When executed, the shell script prompts the user for a password, which is required to extract the contents of the encrypted tar.gz file.
