# HansonXYZ Scripts

This repository is a collection of the most useful scripts that are used on a day-to-day basis. 

## Descriptions 

[**db.sh**](https://github.com/hansonxyz/Scripts/blob/main/db.sh): A handy tool designed for Laravel and WordPress projects that simplifies the interaction with MySQL databases directly from the shell.

[**encrypt_to_shellscript.sh**](https://github.com/hansonxyz/Scripts/blob/main/encrypt_to_shellscript.sh): This script generates an encrypted tar.gz file and a companion shell script. When executed, the shell script prompts the user for a password, which is required to extract the contents of the encrypted tar.gz file.

[**java_project_renamer.py**](https://github.com/hansonxyz/Scripts/blob/main/java_project_renamer.py): This script finds and replaces a namespace with another namespace in a project, and updates the directory structure to match.

[**tmux_remote_persistent.sh**](https://github.com/hansonxyz/Scripts/blob/main/tmux_remote_persistent.sh): This script enables connection to a remote Linux system and initializes a tmux session. It provides resilience by automatically reconnecting to the tmux session in case the terminal is unexpectedly disconnected.
